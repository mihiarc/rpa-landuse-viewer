county_landuse_projections_RPA.*,RPA Scenario,,,"RPA Scenarios are defined by Global Climate Model (GCM), Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP), and Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP). Climate Models: CNRM_CM5 = “wet” climate model; HadGEM2_ES365 = “hot” climate model; IPSL_CM5A_MR = “dry” climate model; MRI_CGCM3 = “least warm” climate model; and NorESM1_M = “middle” climate model. RPA Scenarios are a combination of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs): rcp45_ssp1 = Low emissions forcing, medium growth; rcp85_ssp2 = High emissions forcing, medium growth; rcp85_ssp3 = High emissions forcing, low growth; and rcp85_ssp5 = High emissions forcing, high growth."
county_landuse_projections_RPA.*,Time Step,Years,Integer,Projections are made in 10-year time steps from 2020-2070. For completeness we have included an additional time step (2012-2020) that was used to calibrate the projections for use in subsequent modeling efforts as part of the 2020 RPA Assessment.
